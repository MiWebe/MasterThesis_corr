Add:

0. General:
	- add "Corrected"-watermark to all pages via the "draftwatermark"-package

1. Intro:
	- Information about CREM-Project (see Presi)
	- 
2. Theory:
	- Literature research about calibration of transient models:
		- From ChatGPT as a little starter: "Transient model calibration often involves time-dependent data. Metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Time-Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (TWAPE), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are tailored to handle time series data. MAPE and TWAPE focus on relative errors, while DTW measures the dissimilarity between two time series, considering temporal shifts and deformations."
3. Study Region:
	- Adjust Map (Colour/Height scale)
	- more details on geology
4. Conceptual Model:
	- Graph time series pumping drinking well + irrigation well (one?)
	- Review, if it makes more sense to insert more different maps instead of the cumulated ones now present (Case 1: Fig. 4.2, 4.6 vs. Case 2: figures from presentation)
	- Case 2:
		- Delineation + Boundaries:
			- Refer to both Fig. 3.3 and new (wrapped) figure with only boundaries. Fig. 3.3 when talking about land marks, new figure when referencing the type of boundary.
			- Also remember to reference figure with new/adjusted eastern boundary (3D graph)
	- Drinking + Irrigation Wells:
		- generate + include new graph, showing exemplary well pumping time series (for trend) one for drinking wells, one for irrigation wells
5. Implementation:
	- 
6. Results:
	- add comparison of different simulations with different temporal resolution
	- for sensitivity analysis: another possibility could be/could have been to carry it out on a (if possible) huge range of values (which are all the same for all parameters), and mark the actual parameter-specific ranges following from the literature research with vertical lines (coloured) in the graph, which would be similar to the one on slide 15 in the presentation (but however with the vertical lines).
7. Discussion:
	- add discussion of different temporal resolutions -> no significant differences, therefore reasonable to use less steps
	- add comment on why \theta_{Q,irr} interval was set with lower limit at 0.5. Discuss that this decision was unnecessary since it was not to be expected that the pumping volumes were overestimated. (Original thought leading to the decision: Symmetry of the interval around the "original" value (1), so that the sensitivity of the model to changes could be estimated also for lower values)
