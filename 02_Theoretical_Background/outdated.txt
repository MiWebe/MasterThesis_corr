Accordingly, the change to the stored  difference between the masses $M$ of inflowing water, $M_{in}$, outflowing water $M_{out}$ and water being added through sources or withdrawn from sinks $M_{ss}$ is the amount of water stored $M_{stor}$,

\begin{equation}
    M_{stor} = M_{in} - M_{out} + M_{ss}
\end{equation}

This balance can also be expressed in terms of mass flow rates $dM / dt$ of changes of mass $dM$ over small time increments $dt$,

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dM_{stor}}{dt} = \frac{M_{in}}{dt} - \frac{dM_{out}}{dt} + frac{dM_{ss}}{dt}
\end{equation}

Dividing the aquifer into small control volumes of volumes $V$, the mass within these volumes can be expressed in terms of the density $\rho$ of water, $M = \rho \, V$. With the assumption of a constant density of water $\rho = const.$ follows

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dV_{stor}}{dt} = \frac{V_{in}}{dt} - \frac{dV_{out}}{dt} + frac{dV_{ss}}{dt}
\end{equation}



The aquifer can be divided in a number of small control volumes. 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta M_{stor}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta M_{in}}{a}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item storativity $S$ is the (normalised) volume of water that an aquifer releases at a unit decline in head
    \item The "specific yield is defined as the ratio of (1) the volume of water that a rock or soil will yield by gravity [the drainable volume $V_{W,drn}$] to (2) the total volume of the rock or soil" \parencite{Johnson.1967} (Equation \eqref{Eq-SpecificYield}).
    \item specific yield $S_y$ ($\textrm{L or whatever}$) the portion of the total volume that can be drained by the influence of gravity or pumping.
    \item The other part of the (not this way) drainable pore volume is called the specific retention $S_r$ ($\textrm{L or whatever}$) \parencite{Meinzer.1923}.
    \item (the non-drainable water volume, is called the retained water $V_{W,r}$)
    \item (the non-drainable water itself is called pendular water \parencite{Fetter.2001})
    \item with decreasing average grain size of a porous medium but constant porosity, the surface area increases
    \item furthermore pore sizes decrease
    \item thereby the specific retention increases and accourdingly the specific yield decreases
\end{itemize}
